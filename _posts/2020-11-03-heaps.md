SlimeBreaker is our first project using the Heaps engine. Heaps is an engine written in the programming language Haxe by the creator of the Haxe language. If you've never used Haxe before it's a fascinating language, that compiles to just about any major language you can think of (it can also compile to bytecode that runs on a VM, which is how we are using it).

I decided to make the switch from Unity to Heaps because I prefer to work primarily in code, and I
got tired of constantly fighting with the Unity editor. With compilation times have getting progressively worse the last few versions of Unity, I finally pulled the trigger and switched. I've been watching Heaps
for a few years and the list of successful commercial games using it is impressive.

My brother Zane is the other programmer at Glass Arrow Games, and so far he's enjoyed working with Heaps just as much as I have. We're going to keep this blog updated to document what we learn along the way, both to help out other programmers looking for answers and so that we have an easy repository when we inevitably forget how we solved a problem.
